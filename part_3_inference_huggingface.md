# 3. Inference Workloads using NRP resources including NVIDIA A10 GPUs and Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 Ultra Cards with Hugging Face Models (Instructor: Mohammad Sada)

This session will be about deploying large language models on NRP resources such as the NVIDIA A10 GPUs and the Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 Ultra cards. This session will include details on the architecture of the AI 100 Ultra, including its eight cards, each with four SoCs, for a total of 32 addressable devices each capable of running models up to approximately 25 billion parameters. Participants will learn how to request an individual SoC device and load open-weight models from Hugging Face repositories. They will execute inference workflows, benchmarking model performance, and exploring options for lightweight fine-tuning.

## AI training using PyTorch example

You can use the yaml files from the repo as is but please change the username to something unique as we are all sharing the same namespace. Please download the yaml files using the download raw file button

and edit 

We start by running the training example:

```
kubectl apply -f pytorch-training.yaml
```
Check on status:

```
kubectl get pods
```

When the job is in run state you can check the logs for output:

```
kubectl logs gp3-username
```

Once you are done exploring, please delete the pod:

```
kubectl delete -f pytorch-training.yaml
```

## Text generation inference example

Start up the inference pod:

```
kubectl apply -f tgi-inference.yaml
```

Once the pod is running, get interactive access to the pod:

```
kubectl exec -it tgi-username -- /bin/bash
```

Once in the pod, start a python3 interpreter and then run:

```
from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient
client = InferenceClient(model="http://0.0.0.0:80")
for token in client.text_generation("Who made cat videos?", max_new_tokens=24, stream=True): print (token)
```
## RAG example using Ollama

Start up the pod:
```
kubectl apply -f ollama-rag.yaml
```
Watch the logs and make sure you wait till the installs are done and the book is downloaded:

```
kubectl logs ollama-username
```
Once the book is downloaded (you will see wget output in the logs), we can get interactive access to the pod and start up the Ollama server and pull the module we want to use (Mistral):

```
kubectl exec -it ollama-username -- /bin/bash
cd /scratch
nohup ollama serve&
ollama pull mistral
```
We can now download our test script and run it:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrp-nautilus/nairr-tutorial/main/test.py
python3 -i test.py
```
Now we can run the rag within the interactive python interpreter. Do the following one by one (i.e. wait for results before moving to the next one)
```
rag.invoke("What do you feed pigeons ?")
rag.invoke("Do tame pigeons have better plumage ?")
rag.invoke("What affects pigeon plumage ?")
```

## Helm based deployment of LLM as service (H2O) 

Install helm. Details at: <https://github.com/helm/helm#install>. Quickest option mignt be to download and use static binaries from the release page referenced in link above.

We will be using the H20 project (<https://github.com/h2oai>). Clone the H2O repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/h2oai/h2ogpt.git
```

Copy the values file to the h2o directory:

```
cp h2o-values.yaml h2ogpt
cd h2ogpt
```
Install the helm chart. Make sure you use a unique name (change username below):

```
helm install h2ogpt-username helm/h2ogpt-chart -f h2o-values.yaml
```

Check the pods (kubectl get pods, maybe grep your username since there will be a lot of pods running) to make sure they are running. Once the pod is running, check the logs and see if h2o is running.

It will take some time to load the model into GPU memory.

We can do port-forward to the pod by running in the terminal:

```
kubectl port-forward h2ogpt-<username>-<hash> 5000:5000 7860:7860
```

While the port-forward is running, open another shell and pull the list of models (you need curl installed):

```
curl http://localhost:5000/v1/models
```

If you don't have curl installed, open the [http://localhost:5000/v1/models](http://localhost:5000/v1/models) URL in the browser.

Now we can run a query to the model:

```
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/v1/chat/completions" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "model": "h2oai/h2o-danube2-1.8b-chat",
  "messages": [
          {"role": "user", "content": "How tall are penguins?"}
  ]
}'
```

This helm chart also installs a chat application.

To see the chat UI through the port-forwarding, open [http://localhost:7860](http://localhost:7860) in browser.

Now you can expose the llm by using an ingress (carefully edit all fields with username):

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: haproxy
  name: llm-test-username
spec:
  rules:
  - host: llm-test-username.nrp-nautilus.io
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: h2ogpt-username-web
            port:
              number: 80
        path: /
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - llm-test-username.nrp-nautilus.io
```

You can open llm-test-username.nrp-nautilus.io (with username replaced) in your browser once the forward works. This will give you the H2O interface for chat, ingesting docs etc. Once you are done you can release the resources by doing:

```
helm uninstall h2ogpt-username
```

## End

**Please make sure you did not leave any running pods. Jobs and associated completed pods are OK.**
